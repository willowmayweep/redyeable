# Redyeable

Redyeable is a Fabric mod for Minecraft that makes dyeing blocks like glass and terracotta easier. Blocks can be dyed infinitely and individually, like wool, instead of only once and in groups of eight.

***Supported Versions:** 1.21.7*
***
## Supported Blocks
- Banners
- Candles
- Carpet*
- Concrete
- Concrete Powder
- Glass
- Glass Panes
- Glazed Terracotta
- Terracotta
- Wool*

**These blocks can now be dyed in groups of eight instead of only one at a time*

***

Redyeable will work just fine on singleplayer, but will not work in multiplayer if the server does not have it installed.

*This is my first time developing a mod, so any feedback or suggestions would be very appreciated!*
