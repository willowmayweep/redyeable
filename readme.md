# Redyeable

A Minecraft mod for Fabric that makes dyeing blocks like glass and terracotta easier. Blocks can be dyed infinitely and individually, like wool, instead of only once and in groups of eight.

## Supported Blocks
- Banners
- Candles
- Concrete
- Concrete Powder
- Glass
- Glazed Terracotta
- Terracotta

Redyeable will work just fine on singleplayer, but will not work in multiplayer if the server does not have it installed.

*This is my first time developing a mod, any feedback or suggestions would be very appreciated!*
